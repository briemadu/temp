I have been a research assistant at the University of Potsdam, Germany, as a member of the [Computational Linguistics Lab (colabPotsdam)](https://clp.ling.uni-potsdam.de/), led by Prof. David Schlangen, where I did my Ph.D. The title of my thesis is "Incrementally Enriching the Common Ground: Cognitively Motivated Evaluative Approaches to Dialogue Processing with Deep Learning Models". You can find it [here](https://doi.org/10.25932/publishup-66390).

I'm broadly interested in bridging NLP and cognitive science, as well as in all aspects of evaluation and ethics of language technologies. I also really enjoy doing data analysis. My more specific research topics have been building common ground, incremental processing and clarification requests in multimodal dialogue. I focus on designing theory-based evaluation methods that help us understand the limits of current neural network models to process dialogue phenomena. 

I got my M.Sc. degree in Language Science and Technology at the University of Saarland, Germany. My master thesis was a project in the scope of the [SFB1102 Project A3](http://www.sfb1102.uni-saarland.de/?page_id=249) with Prof. Alexander Koller. I applied semi-supervised learning methods to extract script knowledge from texts.  Before that, I received my B.Sc. in Applied and Computational Mathematics at the [Institute of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.ime.usp.br/en) of the University of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.
